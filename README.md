##Instagram challenge

This project is from the week 7 weekend challenge of the Makers Academy course.
The goal is to try and implement as many features of Instagram to make a clone
of it. I used the paperclip gem to handle the images and tried to keep the code
as clean as possible by moving most code into helpers and modules.

##Challenges

Two days really isn't a lot of time for a project of this scale, especially
considering we just learnt Rails that week and I also used Bootstrap for the
first time for this project. Time was really the biggest constrain since I
didn't try to implement any complex models and kept most things as simple as
possible. Due to this, there are some validations missing and some CSS is a bit
off. Also, I tried to use Factory girl to a greater extent, or to use it in a
cleaner way, but couldn't figure out how, which is something I will look into.

##Technologies used

Ruby on rails

RSpec, Capybara

##How to install

Build Instagram: Simple huh!

As usual please start by

* Filling out your learning plan self review for the week: https://github.com/makersacademy/learning_plan (if you haven't already)
* Forking this repo. After cloning your fork and cd'ing into it, you'll need to [initialize a Rails app in the current directory](http://blog.jasonmeridth.com/posts/create-rails-application-in-current-directory/).

Your challenge is to build Instagram using Rails. You'll need **users** who can post **pictures**, write **comments** on pictures and **like** a picture. Style it like Instagram's website (or more awesome).

Bonus if you can add filters!
